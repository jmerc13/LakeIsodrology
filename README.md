# LakeIsodrology

This R package is intended as one part of an ecosystem of packages dedicated to isotopic analysis for the purposes of infering hydrological processes. For example, using the Craig-Gordon model combined with a time series of observations it may be possible (making some simplifying assumptions) to infer the relative importance of groundwater in lakes over a growing season.

If you have features or ideas you think would fall into the theme of isotope-enabled hydrological inference in the context of lakes or wetlands, please let me know and I'll see what I can do.
